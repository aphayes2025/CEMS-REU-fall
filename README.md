# Cems-reu-fall

This is the GitHub repo for Aidan Hayes's REU in the fall of 2024. The focus is on the workflow for processing satellite imagery. Currently, I'm working on the general workflow, which involves taking imagery and reshaping it to a uniform size for CNN while maintaining proportionate dimensions and then zero padding the remaining area.
